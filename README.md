Bluetooth BLE phone alarm snooze button

## Description
This project is a CircuitPython implementation of a Bluetooth BLE button that uses the volume controls to snooze or turn off your iPhone alarms. This code could also be used as a remote shutter button for the iPhone camera app or my 36Exp ios app.
